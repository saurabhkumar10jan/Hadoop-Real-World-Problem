### DATASET: TWITTER

#### Worked on Questions
-  Q1.What hour of the day does @PrezOno’s tweet the most on average, using every day we have twitter data?   
   Include a plot of the expected number of tweets for each hour of the day, for those he did tweet.  
   For example if Ono tweeted once every day at 12:30PM, his expected number of tweets between 12 and 1 would be 1.
   If he alternates between 2 and 3 tweets per day, his average would be 2.5.  
   > Analysis Inference: President tweets most at 1300 followed by 0700, 2300, 1600 and 1000 hours.  
   
- Q2. What day of the week does @PrezOno tweet the most on average?
